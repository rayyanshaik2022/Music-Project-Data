        "It's hard for me, given the upheaval of the world right now, to talk about silly things like pop music. But that's where we are, that's my job, and that's what I'm gonna do. But first, let me take a selfie.",
        "Yes, The Chainsmokers. Or as they will always be known to me: The #SELFIE Guys. I am more shocked about their comeback than I was for Mike Posner's, and Posner was gone for three times as long. #SELFIE was just from 2014. And what makes it so shocking is that #SELFIE is the definiton of a novelty hit. It was exactly the kind of song that I should be able to dismiss as a blip from two idiots I would never see again. Of course, I've been wrong about the career prospects of a lot of people, like, say, LMFAO, but they had their second song in the same year. If The Chainsmokers couldn't immediately follow up on their big hit, how on Earth could they return two years later?",
        "I'm annoyed by a lot of things about their comeback, but most of all, I'm annoyed that I have to start taking them seriously as artists. The #SELFIE Guys are, in a quantifiable sense, the biggest act of the year. The Chainsmokers. If I could go back to 2014 and tell my past self that 2016 was the year of The Chainsmokers, past me would probably say, \"Wow, 2016 must be the worst in history!\" And I'd tell him, \"Calm down! Things aren't that bad, hahaha, hahaha, also start investing in Xanax. And I mean now, not later.\"",
        "The big question is: \"How do you turn #SELFIE into a sustainable career?\" Good question! Well, apparently by switching from making terrible novelty EDM to terrible generic EDM... that's one possible way.",
        "This was  one of the biggest hits of the year, and it is a disaster. Its an incoherent mish-mash of the worst sounds in pop music, and it of course was everywhere. The Black Eyed Peas may have been banished, but will.i.am's influence remains. But even that was dwarfed by today's song, which is A.) their attempt at a love song and B.) one where they actually sing. That's right, The #SELFIE Douches are now singing.",

        "And, not speaking for myself, just taking the temperature of the room here, seems like the backlash is kicking in, but hard!And goddamn, I'm not surprised. 'Cause, Jesus Christ, who on Earth thought this was a good idea? I daresay there's not a more disliked song in the world right now!",
        "Am I really gonna be the guy to stand up for this? Fine, screw it. I like the song. Quite a bit, if I'm being honest, but hear me out; I totally get why this song is controversial. There are a lot of problems with it. A lot! I mean, first off, Jesus Christ, it's a duet... with Halsey!",
        "And, speaking of artists who made a terrible first impression! I was introduced to Halsey last year with her first mainstream success, \"New Americana,\" an anthem for the new millennial generation.",

That has nothing to do with your generation, you're just trying to make the rest of us feel old! Yeah, every impression I got was that Halsey was like if Kesha was trying to be Lorde, which is not a combo that works.",
        "But I gathered that was a fluke, and she's actually much more an anonymous singer than that, like she's not trying to make a statement, she's just another boring singer.",
        "So yeah, I don't like her, she was another demerit against \"Closer\". But I do like it anyway. Mostly, I like that it's such a songwriterly song. I don't know the last time we had a hit song packed with this much lyrical detail and intense emotion. It sketches a very full portrait of a very complex relationship between two people. And that level of detail is really remarkable in a day and age where you can have a hit song that just says \"Pineapple, pen, apple.\"",

        "Rap is a victorious genre. Having built its history on songs of overcoming the harshest of hard-knock lives, in addition to observances of all of life's nuances, rap is more than just dope beats and rhymes. Its lyrics tell stories with insights and uncommon honesty, traits that have ultimately taken the genre from niched inner-city beginnings to a longstanding place at the heart of pop culture",
        "So it was fitting for Billboard to create a chart, in 1989, dedicated to the then-rising genre, birthed out of hip-hop. At the time, MTV's influential \"Yo! MTV Raps\" was only a few months old, and acts like Ice-T and N.W.A were not only ruling rap but beginning to enter the mainstream music conversation",
        "While rap has evolved, theres no denying its ever-growing power. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Billboards Hot Rap Songs chart, were counting down the top 100 songs in the tallys quarter-century history. From Salt-N-Pepa to Macklemore, we've got the genre's past quarter-century covered",

    "Bad Things by Machine Gun Kelly": [
        "CAMILA CABELLO IS LATE FOR BRUNCH. But not sullen, rock-star, hiding-behind-shades late. More like 19-year-old, mixed-up-the-address late. Shes running through the dining room of Versailles, a Cuban restaurant deep in Los Angeles San Fernando Valley, lush black hair streaming, apologies pouring forth, having just rushed from the other Versailles, in the citys center.",
        "As soon as she sits on this mid-January Sunday morning, flashing that disarmingly broad smile, the singer  who was born in Cuba, resides in Miami and is staying in an Airbnb here in town  says, Ive got you on what were going to eat. She then proceeds to order, in rapid-fire Spanish, a bounty of food: lemonades, steaks, rice, beans, plantains, croquettes, flan.",
        "Confusion, stress, the promise of a splendid feast: That has pretty much been the story of Cabellos recent life. It was only a month before this weekend that she was still a member of Fifth Harmony, the most successful girl group since Destiny's Child, with more than 7 million digital songs sold, according to Nielsen Music.",
        "Before the year was out, she was a solo artist weathering accusations from her bandmates (namely, that she quit through her representatives after dodging a series of label interventions and therapy sessions) and even hate-tweets from zealous fans (see: #CamilaIsOverParty).",
        "But thats the confusion and stress. During that same time, Cabello had plenty to celebrate. The singer, who had collaborated outside of 5H for some time, released the darkly sexy rap-romp single Bad Things with Machine Gun Kelly last October, and it climbed the charts. (Its now No. 1 on the Mainstream Top 40 Chart.) And thats not even her first hit: I Know What You Did Last Summer, her 2015 duet with Shawn Mendes, peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard Hot 100.",
        "She has social numbers to rival the bands (3.4 million to 5Hs 3.8 million on Twitter and 8.8 million to 8.2 million on Instagram), a guest turn on a Major Lazer song banked and enough studio time booked to successfully capitalize on what seems, in retrospect, like an inevitable transition to solo stardom.",
        "It would take a big force to stop her from taking over the world, says her friend Mendes, adding, She was such a great writing partner. I barely had to speak and she knew exactly what I meant.",
        "But Cabello, whose album is due this fall, already had fame, fortune and obsessive fans. The true gift, after five years of nonstop touring, recording and meet-and-greets with 5H, is the taste of freedom.",
        "You know that quote, In the silence, you find God?  asks Cabello, who  in her lace choker, a holey white tee and a black marching band coat  looks like the petite (shes 5-foot-2) commander of some fun and fashionable army. I felt like I could hear everything my heart was telling me.",
        "The heart, of course, can be an unreliable guide, and by going solo Cabello is risking more than the slings and arrows of unhappy Harmonizers. (5H fans  who easily overrun fan polls, like the one for the MTV Video Music Awards 2016 Song of the Summer contest, in which Work From Home crushed massive songs by Calvin Harris and Drake  are not to be underestimated.)",
        "Only one woman has recently left a girl group for a colossal solo career, and shes not an ordinary human: Shes Beyonc.",
        "The closer models for Cabello may be her fellow talent-show contestants in One Direction. But none of their trajectories will quite work for a woman who has to, as it seems all young female pop stars must, thread the wholesome-and-sexy needle.",
        "Zayn Malik disavowed his past, graffitied his home, cloistered himself in a weed cloud and took his sweet time on an album, all of which only made him cooler.",
        "Niall Horan took a backpacking trip, rediscovered the 70s folk-rock of his youth and launched a career as a troubadour, which just made him dreamier.",
        "Harry Styles is already considered a rock star without having sung a solo note.",
        "Cabello, lest she be judged, must be seductive but pure of heart, strong but vulnerable, self-possessed but not selfish. In a way, girl-group rules still apply.",
        "But that hasnt stopped her from building on her momentum, and not just by hitting the studio and bringing Bad Things to The Ellen DeGeneres Show with Machine Gun Kelly in January (her first post-5H TV appearance, a month after Fifth Harmonys final televised performance).",
        "She has also carefully cultivated her public voice, telling Lena Dunham in a Lenny interview before Donald Trumps inauguration: Im going to stick up for immigrants, and Im going to stick up for Hispanic people and their rights.",
        "After Trump issued his immigration order, she tweeted, the #MuslimBan is dehumanizing beyond words... im in shock. THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE.",
        "The easiest route would be to shut my mouth, sing the songs, wear the clothes and keep going, you know? says Cabello with a jittery laugh, weighing life in 5H against going it alone.",
        "I mean,  at the peak of our career. Its definitely not the safe option. But, she says, I have it in my DNA. The way my mom raised me, it has always been: Dont settle. Jump and hope you grow wings on the way down. She flings her arms like shes on a roller coaster. I feel alive!",
        "The lyrics analysis site Genius recently determined that Cabello sang on nearly 45 percent of all the lines in Fifth Harmonys songs. Even when she was doing the most inside the group, Cabello was doing the most outside it, too. She started writing on her own early in 5Hs career, despite the grueling schedule.",
        "Her friend Taylor Swifts Red inspired her to make sonic photographs of her changing life, so when she wasnt cutting parts for 5Hs 2013 Better Together EP at Hollywoods Record Plant, she would be in the studios gym, writing lyrics over other artists melodies about things like my first kiss and my first boyfriend. Then she got GarageBand and a MIDI keyboard, and began churning out shitty demos while touring malls and, in time, arenas.",
        "I would wake up super early, says Cabello, get off the bus, go to the hotel, put the TV on super loud  I didnt want people to hear me fing yelling  then go into the bathroom, put my laptop on the toilet and sit on the floor and write all day.",
        "So she was basically singing into the toilet?",
        "Yep.",
        "She has done her 10,000 hours, says Cabellos manager Roger Gold, co-founder of 300 Entertainment. Fifth Harmony worked incredibly hard 11-and-a-half months of the year. It was an incredible school.",
        "But when it finally came time for Cabello to go solo, bitter, previously unhinted-at feelings erupted in a shockingly public way.",
        "When I ask her about it, Cabello doesnt shy away from discussing the drama of late December 2016, although she clearly means to take the high road:",
        "*When did the relationship between you and the group start to change?*",
        "I dont know. I was always super open  I couldnt just sing other peoples words and be totally happy with that. You have to follow and honor that inner voice. I always encouraged the girls to do the same.",
        "*Do you feel like that changed the relationship, your asserting that?*",
        "I think that in a group there is always going to be tension, whether its because of this thing or  thing. Obviously, I think that rocked the boat.",
        "*Have you been in touch with anyone in 5H since all that went down?*",
        "No.",
        "*Have you reached out directly?*",
        "I did, yeah. I dont want to get into the details of that, because it was really intense and its hard for me to talk about. It makes me sad.",
        "*When I first heard you were going solo, I was like, Im sure there are no hard feelings because this isnt a surprise. Then I was like, Whats happening?*",
        "I had the same reaction. I hoped that it would be a peaceful turning of the page and we would root for each other. But I only got love for them.",
        "Cabello took her first vacation in five years on Christmas, after her mother, Sinuhe, insisted she unplug with the family (including her dad, Alejandro, and 9-year-old sister, Sofia) for three weeks in Cancn.",
        "The first four days were trippy, says Cabello. I was stressing about not stressing about something. Sometimes youre afraid of the quiet. Like, go, go, go!",
        "Cabello was raised in Havana and, later, Mexico City. When she was 6, her folks told her they were going to Disney World. Instead, Camila and Sinu (as shes called) emigrated legally from Mexico, spent a day in holding, took a 36-hour bus ride to Miami and moved in with a friend.",
        "Alejandro was forced to stay behind, but after a year-and-a-half of heartache, he got fed up and took the risk of crossing over. Sinu was an architect in Cuba but found work at a Marshalls, stocking shoes. Alejandro, when he arrived, washed cars at the mall. Today, they have a successful contracting company.",
        "My parents worked really hard, says Cabello. We always had periods where my dad would be out of a job. It was a constant flow of having money, losing everything and then finding a way to get it again. If we had food to eat, a roof over our heads and I was going to school, that was enough.",
        "(Alejandro finally got his visa in 2016, and Cabello sent her parents to Jamaica on the honeymoon they had never had.)",
        "Cabellos Florida friends, who all predate her appearance on The X Factor, reconnected for Friendsgiving in 2016 and FaceTimed an eighth-grade theater teacher who encouraged Cabello when she first got into acting and singing.",
        "Shes not much for going out: I had a phase in Miami where I was like, Im going to do all the things I would do if I were 19,  which she is. I went , and I was like, I dont love this. ",
        "After our brunch in Los Angeles, she plans to meet Troye Sivan for coffee and then have him and Swift over to her Silver Lake Airbnb for some chill stuff.",
        "Mainly, Cabellos focused on making music.",
        "Even her hobbies serve the cause. For song ideas she mines poetry (the book Milk and Honey, by young feminist Rupi Kaur, made her cry), novels (currently: Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garca Mrquez), movies (her favorites include The Notebook, Titanic, Romeo + Juliet and, above all, the 2001 rom-com Serendipity) and inspirational quotes she finds on Tumblr.",
        "She also enjoys practicing guitar  5H player and super close friend Ashlee Juno gave her daily lessons on the groups 7/27 Tour in 2016.",
        "Romantically speaking, says Cabello, I dont have anything going on right now, although she does let slip that literally every boy Ive liked has been a Scorpio. (Rumormongers, take note: Mendes is a Leo.)",
        "And when we start talking about La La Land, she winds up telling an unbelievable story:",
        "I love the movie because Im such a hopeless romantic. It made me feel like I could meet anybody anywhere. Like, yesterday I asked my Uber driver for his number. Because we were actually talking about the movie and he was like, I just came out of a relationship. He just sounded like he was a hopeless romantic. And I was like, You know what? Ill get his number. He never texted me back. What? I dont know. Maybe it didnt go through.",
        "A few weeks after our brunch, in early February, Cabellos in the booth at Sphere Studios in Los Angeles, laptop out and Notes app open, singing from a file called Its Only Natural using her achiest coo and a slight patois: Its only natural, I need some love from you/I might pull up on you/Its only human to, wanna do da tings we do. The vocal is balmy and bright over steel drums and Jack -style edited vocal samples.",
        "I never underestimated her talent, but I was not expecting her to have such a powerful vision, says Andrew Pop Wansel, whos known for his work with Kehlani and Alessia Cara, from the control room.",
        "Its a real collaboration, chimes in co-producer Frank Dukes, who has worked with Drake and Travis Scott. Sometimes its like a band just jamming.",
        "The trio has been honing a handful of songs that skillfully blend Cabellos love for Rihannas ANTI (I can loop it forever, she says), the era of R&B-pop that includes Alicia Keys 2007 song No One, all things Shakira and, of course, Cuban music.",
        "They want to open the LP with a dusty, piano-clanging cut called Havana and preview an upbeat Caribbean heater that sounds like Sia planting a flag in One Dance.",
        "Camila is an incredible songwriter, says Epic Records chairman/CEO Antonio L.A. Reid, who (with Simon Cowell) assembled 5H for The X Factor and still has Cabello on his roster. She is working overtime.",
        "Cabellos mom pops into the studio to remind her she has a call in 15 minutes. Sinu isnt a momager so much as her daughters right hand and confidante.",
        "Along with the other members of 5H, she has been by Cabellos side the entire time, and now shes the only one left who has seen it all. Fifth Harmony, meanwhile, is soldiering on without Cabello.",
        "Epic plans to release an album from the group in 2017, too, and 5Hs Peoples Choice Awards performance of Work From Home in January was an unmistakable shoulder-brush, as Fifth Harmony changed the I to We in Cabellos opening line, I aint worried about nothing, and punctuated it with a full stop.",
        "I know people will try and turn this into, Is she going to be more successful outside the group? If Im growing as an artist, thats success.",
        "In April 2016, I interviewed the members of Fifth Harmony for a Billboard cover story, and the chat quickly turned into a tear-drenched airing of grievances about the groups toll on their private lives. The only one who didnt cry was Cabello.",
        "I was like, Oh, my God, this is the saddest thing Ive ever seen. Im sorry about that, she tells me this time around.",
        "Cabello wasnt immune to the pressures, just on the mend, fighting anxiety with journaling, exercise, meditation and music. I remind her what she told me then  that she had recently been afraid of the things her brain might tell her.",
        "Its so hard to hear that, says Cabello, lowering her head. It breaks my heart. Its like Im watching myself from another persons perspective, like, Damn, poor girl. ",
        "She did finally cry after the turmoil with the group, in Miami with her parents and sister. And then, she says, I went to the beach a lot. I listened only to Latin music.
